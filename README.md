# City Destroyer: Immersive Mixed Reality Game Concept
Overview

"City Destroyer" is an exhilarating mixed reality (MR) game that immerses players into a colossal avatar tasked with the annihilation of sprawling urban environments. Leveraging the power of Unity, the leading game development platform, this project aims to merge the physical and digital realms, providing a unique gameplay experience. By transforming ordinary spaces like tables, floors, or sofas into dynamic cityscapes, "City Destroyer" invites players into a world where their living room becomes the epicenter of destruction.

Gameplay Mechanics

In "City Destroyer," players embody a towering giant, their mission: to wreak havoc upon intricate city models projected onto real-world surfaces through MR technology. The game incorporates physical movement, encouraging players to walk around their play area to discover and demolish every part of the virtual city. As the destruction unfolds, players must also dodge missiles launched by virtual aircraft, adding a layer of strategy and physicality to the gameplay. The challenge escalates with the progression of levels, introducing more complex city layouts and aggressive aerial assaults.

Technology and Compatibility

At the core of "City Destroyer" is the utilization of the Meta XR SDK, a cutting-edge framework designed for creating immersive extended reality experiences. This game is specifically adapted for the Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and the upcoming Meta Quest 3 devices, ensuring a wide range of compatibility and accessibility. The MR experience is refined through the Meta Quest 3, chosen for its advanced capabilities in spatial tracking, rendering, and user interaction, providing a seamless integration of virtual content with the physical world.

Development and Release

The development process of "City Destroyer" is centered around Unity, allowing for a streamlined workflow that encompasses both the creation of immersive 3D environments and the integration of Meta's XR technology. The project's iterative testing phase will be conducted using the Meta Quest 3, ensuring optimal performance and player immersion. Upon completion, "City Destroyer" will be launched through Meta's beta mode, offering the gaming community an early glimpse into this revolutionary MR experience.
